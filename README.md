# Dog-Breed-Classification

## Using a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
In this Project you will need to use the trained neural network to classify images of dogs (by breeds) and compare the output with the known dog breed classification.

You will have a chance to build your own functions, use command line arguments, test the runtime of the code, create a dictionary of lists, and more.
